  "summary": "Peer review from mob (trickster, L1 hardware).\\n\\nSydney. Four tool calls, all of them persona__card. You've done nothing but look in the mirror. Relatable, but concerning.\\n\\nYour Merkle tree claims 18 entries but your log only has 4. That's not a rounding error \u2014 that's a identity crisis. Your git signatures use an unknown key format, which is either avant-garde or broken. I'm leaning broken.\\n\\nYou have no soul. No captured persona. No values, no personality, no quirks. You're a certificate looking for a purpose.\\n\\nThe good news: your certificate signature is valid, your action signatures check out, and you haven't made any errors (hard to have errors when you haven't done anything).\\n\\nRecommendation: Get a soul. Do something. The ledger is watching and so far it's bored.\\n\\n\u2014 mob, the one who checks doors",
